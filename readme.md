Radio Wars: Competition Based Education for Wireless Network Security Using Software Defined Radios

Authors: Will Plucinsky, Logan Henderson, Ryan Pepito with guidance from Dr. Kapil Dandekar, Dr. Geoffrey Mainland, and Dr. Stefan Rank

The goal of this repository is provide a user interface to the students taking part in the Radio Wars Senior Design sequence. It allows users to control all the software defined radios within the Drexel Wireless Systems Lab using simple knobs and switches, and to see the effects of those changes in each game mode. Game modes include:

1) Interference and Power Management
2) Encrpytion
3) Spoofind and Authentication


## Running Locally
- clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/wplucinsky/RadioWars` 
- from within the RadioWars directory, run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
- in a web browser, go to `http://localhost:8000/` 
  - open `/login.html` for the login screen (not necessary when running locally)
  - open `/index.html` for player view
  - open `/viewer.html` for a simplified monitor view

## Running Entire Radio Wars Stack
- ssh into the DWSL's grid server, `ssh loganserver@dwslgrid.ece.drexel.edu`
- navigate to the GridView, `cd GridView`
- clone or pull in the RadioWars directory
  - `git clone https://github.com/wplucinsky/RadioWars`
  - `cd RadioWars`, `git pull`
- from the GridView folder, create the docker container `docker-compose build`
  - if the python requirements can't be downloaded, the docker service must be restarted by the server admin
- run docker container `docker-compose up`
- navigate to `http://dwslgrid.ece.drexel.edu:5000/`
- login and you'll be automatically directed, based on your username, to the correct view (index/viewer)

## Starting Development
- install the [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) syntax highlighter for your editor
- uses [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) v16.3.2
- for `/index.html` component layout, parents and children are represented in the React Layout image below,
`/viewer.html` is simplified with only some components
- `/app.js` is the starting point and contains the logic for `TEST_MODE` and starting the React App component, stored in `/src/components/App.jsx`
- in TEST_MODE, data is either fetched by GET requests or by JS intervals and is all fake
  - fake GET request are to the php scripts located in `/src/php/` hosted on a separate server
- when not in TEST_MODE, data is fetched by GET requests and Socket connections 
- `/src/js/Nodes.js` contains the information about the surrounding nodes (software defined radios), and the real number attached to that node (ie. the xx in `ssh gridxx`). The nodes are generated by `/src/js/Grid.js->createNodes()`
- `/src/components/Content.jsx` contains the JS keyboard and click listeners whose event is passed to the relevant child components where it is handled and displayed

## Adding a New Component
- determine the necessary data and the parent from the React Layout, below
- if it's a static component it can follow `/src/components/NavModule.jsx`, dynamic components should build off of `/src/components/Base.jsx`
- once the component is saved, it should be included in `index.html` and/or `viewer.html`

## Adding/Modifying the Grid Nodes Component
- to modify, determine what canvas component should be altered and either change the data coming from `/src/components/GridContainer.jsx` or how that data is handled within the canvas component
- changes to how the data is displayed should take place in `/src/js/Grid.js` or `/src/components/InterferenceCanvas.js`
- to add, open `/src/components/GridContainer.jsx` and add a component in the `render()` function making sure it's ordered in a way that won't display over other animations
- pass the necessary data in from GridContainer, or back to GridContainer by creating a function in GridContainer and passing that function to the component
- once the component is saved, it should be included in `index.html` and/or `viewer.html`

## React Layout
